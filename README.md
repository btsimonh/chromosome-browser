# chromosome-browser

**Goals**:
* A chromosome browser to easily find overlapping DNA segments between your matches
* Visualize segment data from multiple sources at the same time: gedmatch, familytreedna, myheritage, 23andme or your handcrafted csv file.


Features
* Copy/paste your CSV data (gedmatch, familytreedna, myheritage, 23andme)
* Drag and drop CSV files from your desktop
* No limits on the number of segments
* All the rendering is done on the client side. No data sent to servers.
* No tracking. No Google Analytics.
* Filter by centimorgan (cM)
* Include or exclude kits (persons)
* Different views (compact, by kit, ordered by segment)
* You can save the webpage to your desktop and use the Chromosome Browser without Internet connection.
* double click a segment to highlight all segments for that match.
* right click to highlight all segments which overlap with that DNA kit.
* right click to un-highlight all segments which overlap with that DNA kit.
* Choose to hide segments not highlighted.
* drop a myHeritage matches list(s), allowing right-click to Review match or View tree.


Basically, you can now choose what kits you want to see easily, and interactively.
e.g. I have a distant cousin who shares my great grandfather.  Now I can choose to highlight segements whoich are common with them, and then choose to exclude segments which are common to my great grandfather's wife.

Also identifies segments which have a common start point or end point.  These segments may indicate a common ancestor *above* a known common ancestor if the segment start/end is within a segment from a known match.

These 'interesting matches' may be downloaded from a right click.  The 'contained' flag indicates that either the start or end of the match is within a segment of the first primary kit.

### Actions

when using a myHeritage file, yo can add to the top an actions section to highlight ot unhighlight certain kits and overlapping kits.

this works like the right-click highlight and unhighlight - just saves you finding all the kits you are interested in every time.

Add:
```
action,<kit ID>,<name for ref>,,,,,,,,highlight
action,<kit ID>,<name for ref>,,,,,,,,unhighlight
action,<kit ID>,<name for ref>,,,,,,,,ignore
```

This allows you to pre-highlight kits segments you are specifically interested in.
